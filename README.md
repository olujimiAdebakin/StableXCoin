# **StableXCoin: Decentralized Stablecoin Protocol** üí∞

Dive into **StableXCoin**, a robust decentralized stablecoin protocol engineered for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This project introduces a stable, USD-pegged cryptocurrency backed by **exogenous collateral** like WETH and WBTC. Inspired by the principles of overcollateralization and algorithmic stability, StableXCoin provides a secure and efficient way to interact with stable value within the decentralized finance landscape. üõ°Ô∏è It features a core engine for managing collateral, minting, burning, and a permissionless liquidation mechanism, all secured by Chainlink Price Feeds.

## üöÄ Installation

To get started with StableXCoin, you'll need the Foundry development toolchain installed. If you don't have it, follow the instructions on the official [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Once Foundry is set up, follow these steps:

*   **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/StableXCoin.git
    cd StableXCoin
    ```

*   **Install Dependencies**:
    The project uses Git submodules for external libraries like OpenZeppelin and Chainlink.
    ```bash
    forge install
    ```

*   **Build the Project**:
    Compile the smart contracts.
    ```bash
    forge build
    ```

*   **Run Tests (Optional but Recommended)**:
    Ensure everything is working as expected by running the included tests.
    ```bash
    forge test
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The StableXCoin protocol consists of two primary contracts: `StableXCoin.sol` (the ERC20 stablecoin itself) and `SXCEngine.sol` (the core logic for collateral management, minting, burning, and liquidation). The deployment process is handled by a Foundry script.

### Deploying to a Local Network (Anvil)

For local development and testing, you can deploy to a local Anvil instance.

1.  **Start an Anvil Node**:
    ```bash
    anvil
    ```
2.  **Deploy Contracts**:
    In a new terminal, with Anvil running, use the deployment script. This will automatically create mock price feeds and WETH/WBTC tokens for you.
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeploySXCEngine.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
    ```
    This command will output the addresses of the deployed `StableXCoin` and `SXCEngine` contracts.

### Deploying to Sepolia Testnet

To deploy to Sepolia (or any other public testnet/mainnet), you'll need an RPC URL and a private key with funds.

1.  **Set Environment Variables**:
    Ensure your private key and Etherscan API key (for verification) are set as environment variables.
    ```bash
    export PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." # Your deployer private key
    export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="..." # Your Etherscan API key for verification
    ```
2.  **Deploy Contracts**:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeploySXCEngine.s.sol --rpc-url <YOUR_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL> --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL>` with your actual Sepolia RPC endpoint (e.g., from Alchemy or Infura).

### Interacting with the Contracts

Once deployed, you can interact with the `SXCEngine` contract to:

*   **Deposit Collateral**: Deposit WETH or WBTC into the system.
*   **Mint SXC**: Generate StableXCoin by overcollateralizing your deposited assets.
*   **Burn SXC**: Repay your debt and reduce your minted SXC.
*   **Redeem Collateral**: Withdraw your collateral (after burning sufficient SXC).
*   **Liquidate Positions**: Anyone can liquidate undercollateralized positions to maintain system health.

You can use `cast` (Foundry's CLI tool), a dApp frontend, or a script to interact with the deployed contracts.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Overcollateralized Stablecoin**: Backed by high-quality exogenous collateral assets (WETH, WBTC).
*   **Algorithmic Minting & Burning**: StableXCoin (SXC) can be minted against deposited collateral and burned to repay debt.
*   **Dynamic Health Factor Monitoring**: A robust system to calculate and monitor the collateralization health of user positions, ensuring system stability.
*   **Permissionless Liquidation Mechanism**: Allows anyone to liquidate undercollateralized positions, maintaining the protocol's solvency and offering a bounty to liquidators.
*   **Chainlink Price Feeds Integration**: Utilizes Chainlink's decentralized oracle networks for reliable and real-time asset pricing (ETH/USD, BTC/USD).
*   **Reentrancy Protection**: Employs OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent common reentrancy attacks on critical functions.
*   **Modular Design**: Clear separation between the ERC20 token and the core engine logic for better maintainability and security.
